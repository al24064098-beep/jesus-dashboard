I believe wealth isn't the goal. Stewardship is. God calls us to multiply what we're given — not for our own glory, but for His Kingdom and the generations that follow.

Through CS3 Investments, I've helped investors build passive income through multifamily real estate. But this newsletter isn't about deals — it's about the intersection of faith and finance.

Here you'll find:
• Biblical principles applied to modern investing
• Lessons from building a real estate portfolio
• Reflections on stewardship, legacy, and purpose
• Practical wisdom for faith-driven wealth builders

Whether you're just starting your wealth journey or managing millions, I hope these words encourage you to build with eternal purpose.

To God be the glory.

This newsletter exists for one reason: to explore what it means to build wealth God's way.

You'll receive weekly insights on:
• Faith-driven investing principles

• Stewardship, legacy, and Kingdom building

I don't have all the answers, but I'm committed to seeking God's wisdom in every area — including finances.

Looking forward to this journey together.

In Christ,

                <div class="content-box" id="al-post1">## Why I'm Writing This Newsletter

Three years ago, I closed my first real estate deal.

I thought I was building wealth. I was really learning stewardship.

See, there's a difference. The world says: accumulate, protect, display. Scripture says: multiply, give, invest in eternity.

**The Parable That Changed Everything**

In Matthew 25, Jesus tells the story of a master who entrusts his servants with talents. Two servants multiply what they're given. One buries it in fear.

The master doesn't praise the servants who played it safe. He celebrates the ones who took action.

This parable wrecked me — in the best way.

I realized God doesn't want me to hoard. He wants me to steward. To multiply. To build something that outlasts me.

**What This Newsletter Is About**

Every week, I'll share:
- **Faith foundations** — Biblical principles that shape how I invest
- **Wealth wisdom** — Practical lessons from building a real estate portfolio  
- **Kingdom mindset** — Thinking generationally, not just financially

This isn't financial advice. It's one believer sharing the journey of building wealth with eternal purpose.

**A Question For You**

What does faithful stewardship look like in your life right now?

Hit reply — I read every response.

To the glory of God,
AL

We're launching this newsletter for one reason: **to keep you informed.**

As passive investors, you've trusted us with your capital. That trust comes with responsibility — and part of that responsibility is communication.

**What You'll Get Here**

🏢 **Portfolio Updates**
How are our properties performing? What improvements are we making? You'll know.

📊 **Market Analysis**  
Interest rates. Cap rates. Migration patterns. We'll break down what matters and what it means for your investments.

💡 **Investor Education**
From 1031 exchanges to K-1s, we'll demystify the topics that help you become a smarter investor.

🎯 **New Opportunities**
When we open a new deal, Insider subscribers hear about it first.

**The State of Multifamily (Quick Take)**

Despite headlines about "distress" in commercial real estate, well-located multifamily in growth markets remains resilient. Here's why:

- **Demand is structural** — Housing shortage isn't going away
- **Rent growth is normalizing** — Not 2021 levels, but still solid
- **Distress creates opportunity** — Well-capitalized operators can acquire at better basis

We're actively underwriting deals. When the right one emerges, you'll hear about it here first.

**Coming Up**

Next week: Our Q4 portfolio performance summary across all CS3 properties.
